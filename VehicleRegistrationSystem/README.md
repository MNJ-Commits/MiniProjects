# VehicleRegisterationSystem

## A simple react-native project for vechile registeration using following steps:

### Step #1:

Set up a project in React Native. You can use dummy JSON data to simulate data coming from APIs.


### Step #2:

On the front end, there should be a sign-in & sign-up page. Retain the AUTH data.


### Step #3:

On login, there should be a simple dashboard showing the number of registered cars in your system.


### Step #4:

Make a CRUD page for Cars where the user can select one of the categories from the dropdown & can have other fields like color, model, make, registration-no, etc.

Note: Each create & update module must have front-end validations.
